**Introduction**

GOAL: Our intention is to give shoppers of our storefront the option of AR features with an android application.
A complete virtual store which gives users the chance to experience the masks, clothing and other commodities in AR. 

As of this year, Google has recently announced many more ARCore features to be made available over the web(which is currently pending public release) and Android. Having implemented ARkit and Arcore, we felt it’s time to get the word out there on the true capabilities of these features. 

## TECH STACK:
#### Java (android studio) 
#### Unity 
#### Arcore 
#### Blender 
#### React 
#### Firebase 
#### Javascript 
#### HTML
#### Spark Arstudio

## HOW CAN THIS PRODUCT GAIN MARKET? 
##### ● Contact with various independent artists who would like their merch to be sold on a bigger base. 
##### ● Contact NGOS who work with local cloth and handmade goods markets for production. 


#### FEATURE 1: FILTERS 
People can try on mask filters, cloth filters and select the ones which they love. These merch can range from from superhero characters to hand drawn/ personalised objects. 

#### FEATURE 2: VIRTUAL PORTAL 
Scanning the merch/qr code provided would take to virtual rooms, consisting of fan arts.


## Steps to follow :scroll:

### Star The Repo :star2:

Star the repo by pressing the topmost-right button to start your wonderful journey.

## Building the Project :confetti_ball:
Install Java Development Kit (JDK).

Download, install, and run the latest version of Android Studio, download the Android Studio SDK and set it up correctly.
You can find a guide on how to do this here:(http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio).

Fork and then clone this repository and import it to Android Studio. :fork_and_knife:

Once the gradle build is finished, click on the green play button to build and run the app.


##### Quick Start to Arcore
See the [Quickstart for Android Java](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart)  or [Quickstart for Android NDK developer guide](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/c/quickstart).

##### API Reference
See the [ARCore SDK for Java API Reference](https://developers.google.com/ar/reference/java).
This SDK provides APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps with AR features.

## Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match the `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `FantomsAR-shopping-app` repo
$ git push origin master
```
